1. Compare Multiple Timeframes

   python cli.py analyze AAPL -p 1y
   
   If all 3 show BUY → Very strong signal!

   Don't buy on single signal
   Wait for 2-3 indicators to align

   Check dividend yield (income)
   Review debt/equity (financial health)

4. Use Position Sizing
   Risk only 1-2% per trade
   If you have $10k → Max $100-200 per trade

5. Always Use Stop Loss
   Protects against unexpected drops
   Built-in at -3% (customizable)
